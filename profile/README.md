# ESCSS - Escapes The Developer's Nightmare
![logo](https://github.com/ESCSS-labs/ESCSS/blob/main/assets/logo.png)

## Origin
Inspired by "The Mythical Man-Month," I ponder the question: Does the 'Silver Bullet' that people have sought for the past 50 years truly exist, or is it merely a fantasy?

Reflecting on my past, I’ve come to realize that I often have unconventional and innovative ideas. As these concepts gain increasing validation, I believe the Silver Bullet is within reach. To pursue this possibility, I made the decision to quit my job.

After a period of deep reflection and development, I proudly present ESCSS—an effort to enhance the software ecosystem while also earning income from my work.

## What's different about both licenses?
The key distinction lies in whether **your project remains open-source or is kept private**. Both licenses offer **the same features—no additional commercial components**, now and in the future.

I selected the "Open Core" business model because I think this approach enhances the software ecosystem while allowing me to earn income from my work.
